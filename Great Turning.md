The Great Turning, coined by Joanna Macy, is a shift from the Industrial Growth Society to a life-sustaining civilisation.[1](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/great-turning) Macy identifies three main narratives of our times: "Business as Usual", upholding the growth economy; "The Great Unraveling", telling the story of ongoing collapse of living structures; and "The Great Turning", which is a civilisational transition comparable to the agricultural and industrial revolutions.[2](https://www.awakin.org/v2/read/view.php?tid=2443&lang=English) Macy urges us to recognise what is happening in the world today, and to align our work with the Great Turning and the creation of a life-sustaining civilisation.

According to Macy, there are three dimensions of the Great Turning – that is, three types of actions that are needed for the transition to occur:[3](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/great-turning)

- Actions to slow the damage to Earth and its beings (aka "holding actions")
- Analysis of structural causes and the creation of structural alternatives (aka "structural changes")
- Shift in consciousness (i.e. a profound shift in our perception of reality, as well as in our values and norms)
