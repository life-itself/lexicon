A space designed for deep intentional personal and collective development. It may be physical or virtual. Key is an emphasis on multidimensional inner growth including holding complexity, expanding worldviews and perspective taking. There will usually be medium-term engagement (months to years)  for sustained development. The [[Ecology of Practice]] will be rigorously designed and theory informed.

These spaces relate to, build on and are an evolution of existing environments ranging from executive MBAs to retreat centers to 12-step programmes to intentional communities (ecovillages).

They are distinguished by an emphasis on sustained, multi-dimensional inner development practice [in service of paradigmatic transition]

- **Sustained**: "more than a weekend [or a week]". These spaces are about "states to traits" i.e. looking for developmental stage shifts. As such, they often require sustained engagement e.g. months rather than days.
- **Multi-dimensional**: Informed modern developments in "ontological" practice and sciences ranging from neo-piagetian skills theory to mindfulness research and meditative traditions
- **Service**: this is not just development for its own sake or for personal thriving, it is to support service to wider society.
- **Purpose**: this service is for more than amelioriation, it is in service of a "paradigmatic transition" i.e. a profound shift in the basic worldviews and institutions of modern societies. (See [[Second Renaissance]]).

Additional qualities include an empirical orientation emphasizing active assessment, learning and sharing.
