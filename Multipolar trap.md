Seemingly identical to a [[Collective action problem]] aka coordination problem / free-rider problem etc. Perhaps with slight specialisation that the problem involves many parties rather than the two as in the classic prisoner's dilemma -- and, thus, the problem is worse.

Original source seems to be [[Meditations on Moloch]] where you have the following section near the top:

> It’s easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.
> 
> So you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don’t everyone else will kill you, because if they don’t, everyone else will kill _them_, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god’s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to “everyone agrees to stop doing this at once”, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.

> And okay, this example is kind of contrived. So let’s run through – let’s say ten – real world examples of similar **multipolar traps** to really hammer in how important this is. [emphasis added]

As can be seen by the context, a multi-polar trap is just a classic collective action problem aka prisoner-dilemma type issue -- the example he has just given is precisely a classic prisoner-dilemma example albeit a multi-person version with a very dramatic story. Furthermore, the following examples he gives are all collective action problems e.g. a collective fishing situation with externalities etc.

### Other usage and examples that people are also confused why invent a new term for an existing concept

See e.g. discussion in [https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3vcrbb/whats_a_multipolar_trap/](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3vcrbb/whats_a_multipolar_trap/)

Or [https://conversational-leadership.net/glossary/](https://conversational-leadership.net/glossary/) which states as follows and where the very next paragraph discusses the tragedy of the commons clearly indicating this is just a collective action problem (but given a new name).

> The multipolar trap is a term used to describe a situation where self-interest compels multiple parties to act against their collective interest, leading to detrimental outcomes or even destruction.

### Origin

As far as we can tell, this term came from Slate Start Codex's post [[Meditations on Moloch]] which is quite influential within the general space -- I suspect this was many people's introduction to collective action problems, free riding etc.

### Commentary

Why is this term is used rather than e.g. collective action problem?

[[Daniel Schmachtenberger]] often uses this term, but why he uses this rather than "collective action problem" is unclear.
