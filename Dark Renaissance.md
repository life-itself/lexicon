The idea that there will be a dark age e.g. collapse or serious breakdown before a (second) renaissance.  Also known as “darkness before dawn" or "winter before spring”.

This is analogous with the first Renaissance in Europe where there was a mini-dark age of the 14th century where nearly half of the European population died (Great Famine of 1315-1317, the Black Death etc).

In this case, seeds may go in the ground and hibernate for a while – “last through winter until spring” – rather than renaissance happening immediately.
