Term for the second renaissance story where there is “darkness before dawn" aka "winter before spring” . That is some kind of “dark age” before the (second) renaissance – as there was in the last renaissance where you had the mini-dark age of the 14th century (famine, black death with a third to half of European population dying).

In this case, seeds may go in the ground and hibernate for a while – “Last through winter until spring” – rather than renaissance happening immediately.
