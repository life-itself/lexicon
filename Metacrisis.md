description: "A crisis at the ‘meta’ level, in our civilizational foundations."

A metacrisis is a crisis at the foundations of a civilization, arising from its core views and values – its basic, dominant worldview or “cultural paradigm”. 

Meta tends to denote a self-referential object. A study of many studies is a meta-analysis. However, the idea of metacrisis is not so much a compound or overarching crisis as a foundational set of conditions that generates multiple emergent crises.

On this view, the underlying structure of views and values on which humanity has constructed modern civilization generates and amplifies behaviours that produce crisis symptoms. Understanding the metacrisis is essential if we’re even to begin redirecting our energies towards healing the source of our crises and restoring a stable basis for sustainable planetary civilisation.
